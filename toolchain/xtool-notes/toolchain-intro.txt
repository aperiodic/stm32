A toolchain is a set of tools run, often in sequence, to 
compile firmware from source code and load it ("flash it", 
"move it to flash", "program the ROM" etc) onto 
a development board.

The first step in PSAS avionics development is to build
this toolchain and run a test on the 'target' board.

Expect to build a toolchain on every computer you want
to use for PSAS development.

Here is a typical base set of tools:

text editor (e.g. vim, emacs, gedit or other)
compiler (e.g. gcc)
flash programming utilities (e.g. openocd)
debugger (e.g. gdb)
serial terminal (e.g. minicom)
    (probably need a usb-serial converter cable, you can often borrow one)
