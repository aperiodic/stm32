1. What is a cross compiler? 

    A cross compiler is a tool to compile code on one type
of CPU (instruction set) which will output executables for
a different CPU (instruction set). 


For example: 

Your laptop probably runs an a version of Intel x86 CPU. 

You would like to compile you code to run on an ARM cpu. 

If you compile the code with the 'native' compiler, you will
get an executable with x86 instructions.

If you compile the code with an ARM 'cross' compiler ("x-compiler"), you
will get an executable with ARM instructions.
