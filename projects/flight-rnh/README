* Notes on the serial terminal 
connect an FTDI serial/usb connector to the
appropriate (in rocketnet hub land this is pa9 and pa10)
These are configured as alternate functions in the board.h file.

See the rocketnet-hub schematic for pinout.

    stm		rnethub      ftdi
RX: pa10     ?            tx
TX: pa9      ?            rx

In the mcuconf.h file enable the proper serial subsystem:
#define STM32_SERIAL_USE_USART1             TRUE

In the halconf.h enable the serial system
#define HAL_USE_SERIAL                      TRUE
