* \section intro Introduction
*
* This code is for experimenting with the STM32F407 microcontroller SPI interface
* and ChibiOS with the ADIS IMU.
*
* \section filestructure File Tree
* Here is the basic file tree:
* main.c           - main loop is here
* usbdetail.c      - usb configuration here
* usbdetail.h      - usb configuration header
* chconf.h         - chibios configuration header
* mcuconf.h        - microcontroller configuration header
* halconf.h        - chibios hardware abstraction layer configuration header
* boards directory - this application board configuration files for ChibiOS
