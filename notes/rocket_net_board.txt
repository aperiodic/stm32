CLOCKING:

The PSAS Rocketnet hub chip runs on a 25Mhz crystal
the mcuconf file needs to be changed to:

#define STM32_PLLM_VALUE                    25

This crystal frequency is reflected in the board.h file
as 
#define STM32_HSECLK                25000000


BUILDING:

ChibiOS uses a concept of 'board files' to determine the
IO Connections and settings of a giver board design. There
is a directory in every project called 'boards' which
contains configurations for different boards. To build
a project with the rocketnet hub board:

1)
In the Makefile for a project change this line:

#include ./boards/OLIMEX_STM32_E407/board.mk
include ./boards/PSAS_ROCKETNET_HUB_1_0/board.mk

Or to wherever your board files are for that project.

make clean && make
